# LinkedIn Tips
## Name 
It doesn’t matter whether you go by Lawrence or Larry or if you prefer to include your middle initial in your full name or not. The key is to make sure your name is consistently represented across your resume, LinkedIn profile, and any other online accounts you want to associate with your professional brand.
 
If you have a certification or advanced degree that’s considered valuable in your career, such as an RN, MBA, or PMP, include it after your name. There’s no reason to include the acronym for your undergraduate degree or a certification that’s not relevant to your current job goals.

## Description 
Here are some common symbols that work well as bullets in the Description part of each job:
 
Stars: ★ ✪ ✯ ✰
Arrows: ☛ ☚ ☜ ☞ ☟ ⇨ ►◄ ► »
Traditional Bullets: ■ :diamonds: ◆ ●
Ticks:  ✘ ☐   ☒
 
For additional symbol options, visit Wikipedia’s page: http://bit.ly/1O4Dno0.
 
To use any of the symbols above:
Highlight the symbol you like and copy it by clicking Ctrl-C (or Command + C for Mac users)
Open up your LinkedIn profile and paste the symbol into the appropriate spot by clicking Ctrl-V (or Command + V for Mac users)
 
These work well to create bullets for each job in your Experience section and separate terms in your Headline or Summary.
 
While it’s important to add visual elements to your LinkedIn profile, be careful not to go overboard with the symbols. We recommend using no more than two types of symbols throughout your LinkedIn profile.


## Skills & Endorsements 
A study by the Avid Careerist found that you will rank more highly in LinkedIn search results if you have a greater number of endorsements for the skill a recruiter is seeking. Learn how to maximize your LinkedIn endorsements at http://bit.ly/1ZVpryK.
 
Also, your top 3 skills are visible before having to click “See More”. LinkedIn’s default is to order your skills by the number of endorsements (Highest to Lowest). If there are skills that you would like to highlight that are not listed in your top 3, use the Reorder function to move up those skills you’d like to emphasize. For instructions on how to reorder your skills, see: http://bit.ly/2yoP3RL

## Custom URL
Studies have shown that 93 percent of recruiters will search for your social media profiles after they review your resume. Make it easy for people to find and connect with you by customizing your profile’s public web address.

## Headshot
Studies have shown your LinkedIn profile is 40 percent more likely to get clicked on when you include a profile picture. However, not just any photo will do. When choosing your profile picture, opt for a standard head shot of you that supports your personal brand and portrays you as professional and friendly. Avoid using a group shot, an awkward selfie, or a cropped image where half of your hair is cut out or covered by someone’s arm. To avoid the image looking blurry, select a photo that’s 400 x 400 pixels or larger. If either width or height exceeds 20,000 pixels, your photo will not upload.

## Background Image
Upload a background photo or branded graphic that helps tell your story. The new recommended size is 1584 wide by 396 high. (4:1 proportion). If your background image appears blurry or pixelated, choose an image with a file size as close to the maximum (8 MB) as possible, as images with larger file sizes typically look better. Photos will also look better than images with logos. Click on the following link to learn how to add or change your background image: http://bit.ly/2a5CkIr.
 
## Media Samples
There’s no better way to give employers a better sense of your accomplishments than showing them visual samples of your achievement. You have the ability to provide samples of your work by adding links and uploading presentations, videos, and images to projects you’ve worked on that demonstrate your expertise and skills. Learn how to add, edit, move, and remove work samples to the Summary, Education, and Experience sections on your profile here: http://bit.ly/1Sehoyq.
 
## Additional Talents
You have the ability to add additional sections to your profile to give employers a more personal, 360-degree view of you as a professional. If you speak multiple languages, volunteer in your spare time, or participate in relevant professional associations, add this information to the appropriate sections of your LinkedIn profile. For more information, visit http://bit.ly/1nRTDPv.
 
## Recommendations
How many times have you asked your friends for a recommendation on a product or checked out a company’s reviews on Yelp before purchasing an item? As humans, we often make decisions based upon what’s known as social proof. The same process goes on for hiring decisions. Hiring managers, recruiters, and HR professionals are on the lookout for “social proof” of your talents. LinkedIn recommendations are a perfect opportunity to share reviews from your former employers, managers, peers, direct reports, customers, and clients.

## LinkedIn Groups
Join and actively participate in LinkedIn groups that are specific to your industry and field. Recruiters are notorious for trolling these groups in search of qualified candidates. Don’t forget to join any alumni groups that exist for your alma mater or previous employers. Click on the following link to learn more about joining LinkedIn groups: http://bit.ly/1QHSHbJ.
